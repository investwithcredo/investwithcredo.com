2021  has  been  a  huge  year  for  crypto  currency  and it  has  brought  a  lot  of  newcomers  to  the space  due  to  social  media  and  news  coverage. But  what is  crypto  currency?  Is  it  magic  internet money? And  what  in  the  world  does  hodl  mean?  This will  be  the  first  in  a  series  of  articles  I  write to  cover  such  subjects  and  their  origin.  This  one will  focus  on  the  first  child  of  crypto,  bitcoin
  
### When was it created?

Bitcoin  was  created  in  2009  by  a  presumed  pseudonymous person  or  persons  calling themselves  Satoshi  Nakamoto.  To  this  day  no  one  knows who  Satoshi  is.  He  currently  holds roughly  1  million  of  the  21  million  total  supply, which  is  thought  to  have  been  mined  within  the first  2  years  of  bitcoin’s  existence  and  haven’t  been touched  since.

### What is Bitcoin? 

Bitcoin  is  a  decentralized  digital  currency  that  you can  buy,  sell,  send,  or  trade  without  the  need of  a  bank.  Trust  isn’t  a  factor  when  it  comes  to  bitcoin because  all  of  these  transactions  are done  through  the  block  chain.  Satoshi’s  original  goal for  bitcoin  was  to  be  a  peer  to  peer electronic  payment  system  that  relied  on  cryptographic algorithms  instead  of  trust,  but  it  has turned  into  something  much  more.

### Evolving use cases

Bitcoin  has  turned  into  more  of  a  store  of  value  instead of  a  payment  network  now,  and  for  good reason.  As  I  mentioned  earlier  the  total  supply  that can  ever  exist  of  bitcoin  is  21  million.  This makes  for  a  great  store  of  value  one  might  even  say better  than  gold!  Supply  and  demand  is  a huge  factor  in  this  situation.  We  have  seen  it  in the  real  world  countless  times  when  there  is  not enough  of  something  the  price  usually  goes  up.  This works  the  same  with  bitcoin  as  more people  buy  up  the  bitcoin  the  less  there  is  and  the higher  the  price  will  go.  With  gold  or  fiat currencies  we  usually  discover  more  gold  ,  or  print more  dollars.  Holding  money  in  a  savings account  will  result  in  inflation  eating  away  at  its buying  power.

### How does it work?

The  way  Bitcoin  transactions  work  are  not  quite  as mysterious  as  many  people  think.  First  a transaction  is  entered,  then  the  transaction  is  transmitted to  a  network  of  miners  across  the world,  the  miners  then  compete  to  solve  the  equation to  confirm  the  validity  of  the  transaction. Once  confirmed  to  be  legitimate  transactions  the  miners are  rewarded  and  the  transactions  are then  placed  into  blocks  that  are  chained  together with  other  blocks  creating  a  long  history  of  all the  transactions  that  remain  on  the  block  chain  forever.  This  process  is  how  it  got  the  name block  chain,  and  verified  transactions  can  be  seen by  anyone  and  are  a  part  of  a  public  ledger.

### It is too expensive!

A Lot  of  people  look  at  the  price  of  Bitcoin  and  think it  is  expensive,  and  believe  they  cannot afford    a  full  one,  But  many  people  (Myself  included) dollar  cost  average  into  it  buying  smaller units  of  a  bitcoin.  The  smallest  unit  of  a  bitcoin is  a  Satoshi  and  is  equivalent  to  a  one  hundred millionth  of  a  bitcoin  or  .00000001  bitcoin.

### Fun Facts

The  term  Hodl  was  first  used  in  2013  in  a  post  on a  bitcoin  forum  where  the  user  misspelled hold,  many  people  enjoyed  the  term  and  it  has  been around  ever  since.  To  some  people  hodl stands  for  “hold  on  for  dear  life”.  One  of  Bitcoins most  popular  stories  involves  Papa  John’s Pizza.  On  May  22  2010  a  Laszlo  Hanyecz  traded  10,000 bitcoins  for  2  pizzas  from  the  famous pizza  place,  resulting  in  the  crypto  community  celebrating that  day  as  “Bitcoin  Pizza  Day”.

### The Future

The  future  of  bitcoin  is  an  adventurous  journey  that not  a  single  person  knows  how  it  may  end, the  change  in  attitude  by  big  banks  and  public  companies make  the  future  of  bitcoin  look  bright but  it  is  still  a  very  risky  place  for  your  money even  if  it  has  been  the  best  performing  asset  of  all times.
