Hello World! Welcome to start of Invest with Credo. A community to grow, learn, invest, and prosper together.

The inspiration and direction for Credo started from a simple enough idea, where do we talk about money? It’s odd. Money is something that everyone has in common. Something you could discuss with just about anyone and they would understand. Yet it’s not something we talk about. That needs to change.

The community started simple enough, a group chat. Invite a few people that were investing and let them start talking. That turned into a few more people, and started to grow. It was clear that a community like this was needed and beneficial to everyone. A place to talk and learn about money. 

Credo is the next evolution of the simple group chat. A platform for open discussion, open education, and open knowledge for others to learn through activity about money. Our content and ideas are shared freely. Our discussions happen in public. We are taking the principals of open source software and applying them to finance. 

So what comes next? We will be writing articles and resources for everyone to use on [Invest with Credo](https://investwithcredo.com). The best way to stay up to date is to join [our newsletter](https://invest-with-credo.aweb.page/p/9e43c427-cf60-4bff-9100-574b16615fd0). Everything we share here will first be on our newsletter (with the occasional bonus). To join the group chat head over to the [discussion section](https://github.com/investwithcredo/CredoCommunity/discussions). Talk, ask questions, and learn from everyone in the community.

If you have any questions, ideas, or just want to chat, let us know. Head to the [discussion page](https://github.com/investwithcredo/CredoCommunity/discussions) and ask away. We look forward to sharing what we have learned and learning from you.  

From the CREDO Team (Stephen, Boubacar, and Neal)
